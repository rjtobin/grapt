grapt
==============

A framework to automatically generate reports based
on user-defined graph theoretic properties.  It is designed
to test the given graph property against a large database
of graphs (the existing library consists of more than 100 
million graphs).  A LaTeX report is generated including information
such as which graphs attain the maximum and minimum values of
this graph property, as well as the behavior of random graphs
with respect to this property.  Random graph models include
GNP, Chung--Lu and random polynomial graphs.
